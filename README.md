# Flocking-Project
Flocking Algorithm Project CSC395 By Moua, Godwill, Skyler.

Our Flocking Algorithm will use a Circle class object as boids that will comprises of three main functions which are Cohesion, Alignment, and Seperation Using a Vector as direction. The cohesion function is having one of the boids move towards the average position which will bring in other boids to follow that specific boid. The Alignment function is used for having the other boids follow its neighbors in the same direction when in a group. The Seperation function is used to repel each boid if they come into contact too close with one another or is going to hit an obstacle. The Algorithm will generate flocks of circles with sliders of these three functions with the control of the flocks population up to 20.

The Resources Below show examples of how these 3 functions can be used with boids and different vector types.
